# Typescript Tutorial

Finally giving this a try

## Setup and using Jest

Used [this really useful link](https://swizec.com/blog/how-to-configure-jest-with-typescript/) to get setup with Jest

Had to remove the `"spec_dir"` entry from `jasmine.json` for it to work with TS - not really and issue as JEST runs Jasmine tests just fine using TS

## Scripts

- **build**   - TS build
- **test**    - Jest test
- **jasmine** - Jasmine test

**Makefile** also exists ðŸ˜‡ - use `make help`
